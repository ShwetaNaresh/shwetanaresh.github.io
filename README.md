Let's get started to bake a moist and soft classic chocolate cake....

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees.
2. Grease a cake tin and place the parchment paper at the bottom of the tin.
3. Mix all the dry ingredients.
4. In a separate bowl mix the vegetable oil, milk, eggs, and vanilla extract, and whisk till light and fluffy.
5. Add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture and fold the mixture till it is mixed well.
6. Slowly add the boiling water and mix well.
